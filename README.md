These scripts are from the team Forbes Space Analytica for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024. This project is meant to detect seismic wave both in the Moon and Mars, but it isn't fully implemented together. The detection algorithm uses AI crosscorrelation to compare new data with already identified seismic waves.
