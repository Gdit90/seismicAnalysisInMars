# seismicAnalysisInMars
These scripts are from the team Forbes Space Analytica for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024. This project is meant to detect seismic wave both in the Moon and Mars, but it isn't fully implemented together. The detection algorithm uses AI crosscorrelation to compare new data with already identified seismic waves.
It contains: One script for data visualization in Python, one script with the algorithm 'magnitude discriminant' wrote in R language, and one python file with the premilinary version of the GUI.
These scripts are NOT fully developed, since we weren't able to joint them together due to time limitations, however with the few tests we we're able to run we find the scripts are able to generate the detection.

Thanks NASA for this oportunity!
